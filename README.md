# Welcome

The purpose of this repository is to accept applications to work on a podcast in a capacity of either a producer or a presenter. They are hosted on Google forms for now. Links to the web forms are below: 

- [Producer Application](https://forms.gle/Nh4ZeKsctaxejBxf8)

- [Presenter Application](https://forms.gle/mKQw99K32pciQDcg9)

The raw text of how the web forms are designed is put in notepads named accordingly. If you wish to improve or edit the form, kindly work on the layout provided in the notepad bearing in mind about the presentation framework of Google forms then submit a PR request.

If you wish to comment your submission, kindly do it in active voice and notate it properly for its indication. 

The web form can extend into an application in the future but kindly keep an eye on the BAG and Changelog in the central repository to access your timing for a PR request.
