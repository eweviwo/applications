# Welcome

The purpose of this repository is to design and solicit applications for producers or presenters for the project. Applications are hosted on Google forms for now. Links to the web forms are below: 

- [Producer Application](https://forms.gle/Nh4ZeKsctaxejBxf8)

- [Presenter Application](https://forms.gle/mKQw99K32pciQDcg9)

The Google forms can be edited under a different formality. The raw text of the forms are presented in notepads within this repo. If you wish to improve or edit the form, kindly work on the layout provided in the notepad bearing in mind about the presentation framework that Google forms use. Submit a PR about your changes. 

If you wish to comment your submission, kindly do it in active voice and notate properly for its indication. 

The form can extend into an application in the future but kindly keep an eye on the BAG and Changelog in the central repository to access your timing for a PR request.
