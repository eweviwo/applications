# Welcome

The purpose of this repository is to design and application forms for producers or presenters for the recording of podcasts for the project. Applications are hosted on Google forms. Links to the web forms are below: 

- [Producer Application](https://forms.gle/Nh4ZeKsctaxejBxf8)

- [Presenter Application](https://forms.gle/mKQw99K32pciQDcg9)

The raw text of the forms are presented in notepads in this repo. If you wish to improve or edit any of the forms, kindly work on the layout provided in the notepad bearing in mind the presentation framework that Google forms offer. Submit a PR about your changes. 

You are welcome to comment your submission. Kindly offer as much clarity as you can.  

The form can extend into an application in the future but this is dependent on the BAG and Changelog in the central repository.
